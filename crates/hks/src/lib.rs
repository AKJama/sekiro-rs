//! A HavokScript (HKS) virtual machine that runs the game's own compiled character scripts.
//!
//! Sekiro drives player and enemy behaviour from compiled HKS (a Lua 5.1 derivative) in
//! `action/script/*.hks`. The engine calls script functions every frame (`Update`, and
//! `<State>_onUpdate` / `_onActivate` / `_onDeactivate` for active behaviour states), and the
//! scripts call back through `env`, `act` and `hkb*` functions, which a simulation provides by
//! implementing [`Host`].
//!
//! The VM is original code. Format and opcode knowledge come from public community work; see
//! `docs/HKS-INTERFACE.md`.
