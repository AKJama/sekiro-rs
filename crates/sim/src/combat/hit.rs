//! Deciding whether an attack hits, is blocked, or is deflected.
//!
//! Source: the defender's damage module, `b6c880` (the first stage of applying one hit record,
//! called from `b6f690`). The steps, in the engine's order:
//!
//! 1. The defender must be in a guarding state, and the arc test must pass (or the attack must
//!    ignore direction with `isAllDirGuard`). Read from code.
//! 2. The defender's repel defence is computed (guarding or not) and raised to the highest
//!    `defFlickPower` of its active SpEffects. Read from code (`842fb0`, `bfc440`).
//! 3. Repel defence below the attack's repel power means a block, unless the attack is
//!    unblockable for the defender's guard type, in which case it is a direct hit.
//!    Repel defence at or above it means a deflect, unless the attack is undeflectable for that
//!    guard type, in which case it is a direct hit. Read from code.
//!
//! So the deflect window works by raising repel defence: the window effect 105010 has
//! `defFlickPower` 40, ordinary NPC attacks have `guardAtkRate` 30, and the Kusabimaru's own guard
//! repel is 20 (`guardBaseRepel`). Inside the window 40 >= 30 deflects; outside 20 < 30 blocks.
