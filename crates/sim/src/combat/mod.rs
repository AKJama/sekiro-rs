//! Engine-side combat rules: hit resolution, HP and posture damage, posture recovery and the
//! damage codes the player script reads.
//!
//! Everything here is original Rust written from our reading of `sekiro.exe` 1.6.0.0 in Ghidra
//! (see `docs/COMBAT-RULES.md` for the rule list, the source RVAs and the open questions).
//! Every formula carries a source tag:
//!
//! - **read from code**: the arithmetic, order and rounding were read from the named function.
//! - **inferred**: the shape was read from code but the meaning of an input (which param field
//!   fills a record slot, for example) was inferred from matching offsets or values.
//! - **def** or **community**: taken from the Paramdex description or a community source.
//!
//! Sekiro's data calls posture "stamina". The engine stores the *remaining* posture: it starts at
//! the maximum, damage lowers it, and the bar on screen is `max - remaining`. A posture break is
//! the remaining value dropping below 1.
//!
//! All arithmetic that the engine does in single precision is done in `f32` here, and every
//! float-to-integer conversion truncates toward zero like the engine's `cvttss2si`, unless a
//! function says otherwise.
